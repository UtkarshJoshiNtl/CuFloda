**S-Stream is an interactive fluid dynamics tool that lets you see how fluids behave in real time.** Watch vortices shed behind a cylinder, see pressure drop across a nozzle, or understand how Reynolds number changes flow patterns—all in seconds, not hours.

## Who This Is For

- **Students** learning fluid mechanics who want to visualize concepts like Reynolds number, drag, and vortex shedding
- **Self-learners** exploring fluid dynamics without needing a supercomputer or commercial CFD license
- **Educators** who need a live, interactive demonstration tool for classroom teaching

**What this is not:** S-Stream is not a replacement for OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, or other professional CFD suites. It's a learning and intuition-building tool, not a production engineering solver. If you need industrial-grade accuracy for aerospace or automotive design, use those tools. If you want to understand *how* fluids behave, use S-Stream.

## Why You Can Trust What You See

S-Stream is built around honesty. We don't hide behind marketing claims—we validate:

- **Verified physics:** The core 2D LBM engine (D2Q9 BGK) passes validation tests against analytical solutions (Poiseuille flow, lid-driven cavity) and experimental benchmarks (cylinder drag coefficient)
- **Sanity checks:** The app warns you when simulation parameters violate assumptions (e.g., Low-Mach number limits, relaxation rate stability)
- **Confidence badges:** Every running simulation shows a confidence score that tells you whether the flow has converged or is still developing
- **Labeled capabilities:** Features are clearly marked as **Verified**, **Experimental**, or **Hidden** in [TRUST.md](TRUST.md)—no guessing what's production-ready

See the validation suite: `pytest tests/validation/ -v`

## Quick Start

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install s-stream
s-stream
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UtkarshJoshiNtl/S-Stream.git
cd S-Stream
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python main.py
```

### CLI flags

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--headless` | No GUI (for benchmarks/scripts) |
| `--width N --height N` | Custom grid size |
| `--steps N` | Run N steps then exit (with --headless) |

Advanced flags (`--liquid`, `--multicomponent`, `--gpu`, `--serve`) are available but target experimental features. See `python main.py --help` for details.

## Core Features

- **Live 2D simulation** — Watch fluids flow in real time with D2Q9 Lattice Boltzmann Method
- **Guided scenarios** — 10 built-in presets (vortex shedding, channel flow, lid-driven cavity, etc.) with explanations
- **Interactive geometry** — Draw circles, rectangles, polygons, and obstacles directly on the viewport
- **Physics readouts** — Real-time Reynolds number, drag coefficient, Strouhal number with tooltips explaining what they mean
- **Confidence badges** — Visual indicator showing whether the flow has converged or is still developing
- **Export for reports** — PNG figures, Markdown summaries, and CSV data for lab reports
- **Probes** — Place measurement points to track velocity, pressure, and vorticity over time
- **Beginner/Expert modes** — Simple interface for learning, advanced controls for exploration

## How It Works

S-Stream uses the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), specifically the D2Q9 model for 2D simulations. Instead of solving the Navier-Stokes equations directly, LBM simulates particle distributions on a discrete lattice that stream and collide. This approach is particularly well-suited for complex geometries and parallel computation.

The core physics (D2Q9 BGK collision) is validated against analytical solutions and experimental benchmarks. See [TRUST.md](TRUST.md) for details on what's verified vs experimental.

## Testing & Validation

```bash
pytest                                    # full suite
pytest -m "not slow"                      # skip slow tests
pytest tests/validation/ -v               # validation benchmarks
```
